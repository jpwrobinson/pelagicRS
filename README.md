This is a group project to extract remote-sensing oceanographic products for tropical marine ecosystems.



**Objective 1:** extract sea surface height for focal ecosystems in West Africa, the Maldives, and tropical Pacific.

We first need to save the remote sensing product for SSH and shapefiles of coastlines / coral reefs.

**Task 1:**

* download the remote sensing product from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.godas.html
* download the shapefile for your ecosystem (try ```rnaturalearth```?)
* Upload (commit + push) these to Github
